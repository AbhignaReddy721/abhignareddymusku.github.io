I enjoy practicing yoga. It's my favorite form of exercise and adds balance to my life. Started teaching since late 2024 as a debt of gratitude towards my teacher, Yogi Bheemaiah.

Attached a pdf below with a set of exercises I usually work with. As I kept practicing more, I couldn't help but appreciate how beautifully and thoughtfully they were designed. The teacher I learnt it from compiled these into a file with pictures,( excuse the clarity, it was shot really long back ). I'm currently working on getting these into a video format.

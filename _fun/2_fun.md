Got into composting a couple of months ago when I saw a video of someone describing how the food waste we generate can be turned into soil, if not diverted to landfills. I got curious and started experimenting with it. After some experiments and a failed attempt, was successful in turning food scraps into soil!  
Observing how interconnected and circular things are, was a lot of fun and it made me realize ( even though in quite a literal sense in this case ), nothing ever really is waste, if you know how to transform it :)

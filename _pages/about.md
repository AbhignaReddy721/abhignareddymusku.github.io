Hello! I'm Abhigna. 
I'm currently working as an Analytics Developer in the Health, Safety and Environmental Division at International Paper.

I graduated with a Master's degree in Industrial Engineering specializing in Data Science and Analytics from Northeastern University, Boston, where I worked with Prof. Summer Xiao on applications of Large Language Models in Accounting.  
Prior to that I pursued a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad in India.

Sustainability and AI are two areas where I'm currently interested to contribute. More specifically, Iâ€™m exploring the intersection of understanding how people are using AI in their day-to-day lives, it's societal impacts and policy implications and exploring how to build these tools that benefits everyone collectively.  

I'm also curious into learning more about the capabilities and risks of these systems and finding ways to communicate these learnings.

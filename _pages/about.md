Hello! I'm Abhigna. 
I'm currently working as an Analytics Developer in the Health, Safety and Environmental Division at International Paper.

I graduated with a Master's degree in Industrial Engineering specializing in Data Science and Analytics from Northeastern University, Boston, where I worked with Prof. Summer Xiao researching Large Language Model applications in Accounting. 
Prior to that I pursued a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad in India

Outside work I enjoy practicing and teaching yoga, meditating, dancing and recently got into composting.
